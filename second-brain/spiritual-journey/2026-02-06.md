# The Day I Stopped Numbing

**Date:** Friday, February 6, 2026
**Focus:** Choosing to feel pain is the first step to freedom

## Video Script

**[HOOK - 3-5 seconds]**
"For nine years, I was terrified of feeling anything. Today I want to tell you why."

**[BODY - 45-60 seconds]**
"From 1997 to 2006, I numbed myself. Every single day.

Not because I was weak. Because feeling hurt too much.

Growing up, I was criticized constantly. Emotionally neglected. Bullied. I learned early that being vulnerable meant being destroyed.

So I found ways to not feel. For nine years.

Here's what nobody tells you about numbing: You can't just turn off the bad feelings. You turn off *all* of them. Joy. Connection. Love. I was so afraid to love that I built walls no one could climb.

The day I stopped wasn't dramatic. It was quiet. I just got tired of being a ghost in my own life.

If you're numbing right now — with substances, with scrolling, with staying busy, with anything — I'm not here to judge you. I *was* you.

But I need you to know: On the other side of that pain you're avoiding? That's where your actual life is waiting."

**[PRACTICAL STEP - 15 seconds]**
"Today, try this: When an uncomfortable emotion shows up, don't reach for the escape. Just notice it. Say out loud, 'I feel ___.' That's it. You don't have to fix it. Just acknowledge it exists."

**[CALL TO ACTION - 5-7 seconds]**
"What have you been numbing? You don't have to share details — just drop a 🖤 if this hit home."

**[Pro Filming Tip]**
Film in a quiet, intimate setting — maybe by a window with soft natural light. Speak slowly. Let there be pauses. This is a confession, not a performance. Eye contact with the camera is essential. Consider filming in black and white for added emotional weight.

## Behind the Story

**What I was going through:** Nine years (1997-2006) of addiction — using substances to escape the pain of a childhood filled with emotional neglect, constant criticism, and bullying. I had learned that feeling meant hurting, so I chose not to feel at all. I was terrified of love because everyone who should have loved me had caused pain.

**What I learned:** Numbing doesn't protect you — it imprisons you. You can't selectively turn off emotions. When you numb pain, you also numb joy, connection, and love. The only way out is through.

**How it changed me:** I slowly learned that feeling pain doesn't destroy you — avoiding it does. That realization was the first crack in the walls I'd built. It took years to fully heal, but that moment of choosing to feel was when my real life began.
