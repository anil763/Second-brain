# When Your Body Forces You to Wake Up

**Date:** Saturday, February 7, 2026
**Focus:** Sometimes your body becomes your greatest spiritual teacher

## Video Script

**[HOOK - 3-5 seconds]**
"In 2019, my body screamed so loud I had no choice but to listen."

**[BODY - 45-60 seconds]**
"Pancreatitis. Type 2 diabetes. Hearing loss. All at once.

I remember lying in that hospital bed thinking: How did I get here?

But I knew. I had ignored every warning sign. Every whisper from my body that something was wrong. I was too busy surviving to actually *live*.

Here's the brutal truth I learned: When your soul has a message and you won't listen, it eventually speaks through your body. And the body doesn't whisper — it screams.

My health crisis wasn't punishment. It was intervention.

It forced me to stop. To actually look at my life. To ask the questions I'd been running from for decades.

Maybe you're running too. Maybe you're pushing through exhaustion, ignoring symptoms, telling yourself you'll deal with it later.

I'm telling you from the other side: Your body is trying to save you. The question is whether you'll listen before it has to scream."

**[PRACTICAL STEP - 15 seconds]**
"Right now, do a body scan. Close your eyes. Where do you feel tension? What has your body been trying to tell you that you've been ignoring? Write it down. That's step one."

**[CALL TO ACTION - 5-7 seconds]**
"Has your body ever forced you to slow down? What did it teach you? Share below — your story might help someone else listen."

**[Pro Filming Tip]**
Film this sitting down, maybe in a comfortable chair or on a couch. This is reflective, not energetic. Soft, warm lighting. Consider having a moment where you pause and touch your heart or take a deep breath — let the audience feel the weight of the journey. Authentic emotion over polish.

## Behind the Story

**What I was going through:** In 2019, everything crashed at once. Pancreatitis hit first, then the diabetes diagnosis, then I realized my hearing was failing. Years of neglecting my physical and emotional health had accumulated into a full system breakdown. I was in a marriage I'd entered from resignation rather than love, still carrying wounds from childhood, still recovering from addiction years. My body had finally had enough.

**What I learned:** The body keeps score. Every ignored emotion, every unprocessed trauma, every "I'll deal with it later" — it all accumulates. A health crisis isn't random bad luck; it's often the body's last resort to get your attention. Mine was a forced spiritual awakening.

**How it changed me:** I finally started treating my body as a partner instead of a machine to exploit. I began the real healing work — not just physical, but emotional and spiritual. The health crisis became the catalyst that pushed me onto the path I'm on today. I would never have found this depth of healing without being forced to stop.
