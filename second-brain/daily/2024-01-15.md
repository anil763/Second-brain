## Morning Pages

Started the day with some focused work on the Second Brain project. The markdown rendering is coming together nicely.

## What I'm Working On

- Building out the document viewer component
- Implementing full-text search
- Setting up the folder navigation

## Today's Insights

> "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." — Chinese Proverb

This applies to note-taking too. Don't worry about past notes you didn't take. Start now.

## Reading

Currently reading "Building a Second Brain" by Tiago Forte. Key takeaways:
- Capture what resonates
- Organize for actionability
- Distill to the essence
- Express through creation

## Tasks

- [x] Review [[Getting Started with Second Brain]]
- [x] Add sample documents
- [ ] Implement wiki link parsing
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle

## Evening Reflection

Productive day. The act of building tools to think better is itself a form of thinking better.
