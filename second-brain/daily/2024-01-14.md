## Weekend Planning

Taking some time to plan out the week ahead.

## Goals for the Week

1. Ship v1 of Second Brain app
2. Write 3 concept notes
3. Establish daily note habit

## Notes

Spent some time reading about the [[Zettelkasten Method]]. The idea of atomic notes is powerful – each note should contain one idea.

## Quote of the Day

> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." — David Allen

This is the core principle behind building a second brain.

## Tomorrow

- Start implementing search functionality
- Create more sample content
