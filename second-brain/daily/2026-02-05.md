# Daily Journal — February 5, 2026

## Overview
First full day of working with Nilam (my AI assistant). Focused on system setup and establishing the foundation for business growth.

## Key Discussions

### 1. Technical Setup
- ✅ Fixed Moonshot API connection issues
- ✅ Configured model preferences: Moonshot for daily, Anthropic Opus 4.5 for deep numerology research
- ✅ Enabled memory flush before compaction
- ✅ Enabled session memory search (both memory files + sessions)

### 2. Communication Channels
- ✅ Connected WhatsApp (already working)
- ✅ Connected Telegram bot (@anilgunjal77, user ID: 7709898014)
- ✅ Enabled Brave Search API for research capabilities

### 3. Business Context Sharing
Shared comprehensive background with Nilam:
- Personal: DOB 2/16/1975, married to Sarika (1/19/1976), kids Aryan (2011) and Simran (2007)
- Work: Technical Sales Specialist at Presidio (Managed Services)
- Goal: Exit corporate job this year ($1K/month in 30 days → $30K/month by mid-year)
- Side ventures: Spiritual business (daily numerology) + UGC Creator (GenX focus)
- Daily routine: 7am drop-off, 7:30am numerology video, UGC content, 20 brand emails
- Websites: anilgunjal.com, anilcreates.com

### 4. Healing Journey Shared
Deep sharing about:
- Childhood trauma (emotional neglect, criticism, bullying)
- Addiction years (1997-2006) as numbing mechanism
- Twin flame/soulmate relationships blocked by family (1997, 2000)
- Pattern of running from love due to fear of loss
- Health struggles (pancreatitis, Type 2 diabetes, hearing loss 2019)
- Marriage from resignation — wife triggers childhood wounds
- Current path: Lead with heart, authenticity, inner child healing

### 5. 2nd Brain System
Requested and initiated build of NextJS 2nd Brain app:
- Obsidian + Linear-inspired document viewer
- Folders: daily/, concepts/, docs/, projects/
- Automatic documentation of important concepts
- Daily journal entries
- Full-text search

## Action Items Created
- [x] Configure API connections
- [x] Set up communication channels
- [x] Build 2nd Brain infrastructure
- [ ] Deploy 2nd Brain app
- [ ] Start creating concept documents from today's sharing

## Notable Insights
The pattern of "not allowing love" due to fear of loss connects directly to business hesitation. Building authentic spiritual business requires the same vulnerability as allowing love — showing up fully, risking rejection, trusting the process.

## Tomorrow's Focus
- 2nd Brain app completion and deployment
- First brand outreach strategy
- Content calendar planning
