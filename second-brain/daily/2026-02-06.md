# February 6, 2026

## ✅ Technical Fixes

### Second Brain Repair (9:24 PM)
- **Issue:** Second Brain app wasn't accessible - returning 500 error
- **Root Cause:** Corrupted Next.js build cache (`.next` folder had missing module './948.js')
- **Solution:** 
  1. Killed broken server process
  2. Deleted `.next` build folder
  3. Restarted dev server fresh
- **Status:** ✅ Running at http://localhost:3000

### OpenClaw Configuration Update  
- Added `opus 4.5` alias for Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 model
- Now easily accessible via `/model opus 4.5` command
- Updated MEMORY.md with available model aliases

## 🌙 Blog Automation Progress

### Self-Love Article Published (11 PM)
- First of 7-day blog blitz completed
- "The Complete Guide to Self Love" - 1800+ words
- SEO-optimized, featured image, proper categorization
- Published to anilgunjal.com

### Upcoming Schedule
- Feb 6 (Tonight): Spiritual Awakening guide
- Feb 7: Life Path Numbers
- Feb 8: Inner Child Healing
- Feb 9: Shadow Work
- Feb 10: Emotional Healing
- Feb 11: Finding Your Purpose
- Feb 12: Aligned Masculinity (Gentlemen's Vault tie-in)

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Next.js cache issues** - When dev server throws module errors, clearing `.next` often resolves
2. **Model aliases** - Using short aliases like `opus 4.5` makes model switching faster
3. **Blog automation** - Featured images are critical; always verify upload before marking complete

## 📝 Notes for Tomorrow

- Spiritual Awakening blog post will auto-publish tonight at 11 PM
- Morning brief scheduled for 6:30 AM with weather + numerology
- Continue Gentlemen's Vault launch prep (March 1st target)
