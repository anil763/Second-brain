# 🧠 Second Brain

Welcome to your Second Brain — a living knowledge base that grows as we work together.

## Structure

```
second-brain/
├── daily/          # Daily journal entries
├── concepts/       # Deep dives on important ideas
├── docs/           # General documents & notes
└── projects/       # Project-specific documentation
```

## How It Works

1. **Daily Journals** — Every day, a new entry captures our discussions at a high level
2. **Concept Documents** — When we explore important ideas, they get their own deep-dive page
3. **Project Docs** — Active projects have dedicated spaces
4. **Search Everything** — Full-text search across all documents

*This system evolves with you. The more we discuss, the richer it becomes.*
