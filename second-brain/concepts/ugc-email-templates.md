Subject: UGC for [Brand] — GenX creator, real results

Hi [First Name],

I'm Anil — a UGC creator focused on apps, finance, and smart home tech for the GenX audience (40-60).

Quick context: I actually use [Product]. [One specific detail about how you use it or what you like about it].

Most UGC creators are in their 20s. Your GenX customers want to see someone who looks like them, talks like them, and actually understands why [specific benefit] matters at this stage of life.

Here's my portfolio: [Portfolio Link]

I'd love to create 2-3 pieces for [Brand]. Typical turnaround is 5-7 days.

Worth a quick chat?

Subject: Re: UGC for [Brand] — GenX creator, real results

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from [Day]. 

I wanted to share a quick win: [Insert recent result, testimonial, or relevant stat — even if it's engagement on your own content]

Still think there's a great fit here. [Brand]'s audience skews older than most — and that's exactly who I create for.

Happy to send over a spec concept if that's helpful.

Anil

P.S. Here's a recent piece I did for [similar brand/niche]: [Link]

**Subject Line Options:**

- Closing the loop
- One more thought for [Brand]

**Email Body:**

Subject: Closing the loop — [Brand]

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short — I know your inbox is slammed.

If UGC isn't a priority for [Brand] right now, totally get it. I'll circle back in a few months.

But if timing is just off and you'd want to revisit later, just reply "later" and I'll follow up in [30/60/90] days.

Either way, appreciate you reading this far.

## Variations by Niche

### Apps Pitch (Personalized)

Subject: UGC idea for [App Name]

Hi [First Name],

I've been using [App Name] for [time period] to [specific use case]. It's genuinely changed how I [benefit].

I create UGC for the GenX audience — the 40-60 crowd that most creators ignore. We're the ones with disposable income, but we want to see real people using products, not influencers half our age.

I'd love to create a few authentic pieces showing how [App Name] fits into a busy professional's life.

Portfolio: [Link]

5-7 day turnaround, and I handle everything (scripting, filming, editing).

Worth 10 minutes to explore?

### Finance Pitch (Personalized)

Subject: UGC for [Finance Brand] — targeting the right demo

Hi [First Name],

Here's the thing about finance content: GenX is the prime audience — we're peak earning years, thinking about retirement, and we actually have assets to manage.

But most finance UGC is made by 25-year-olds who've never maxed out a 401(k).

I'm a 50-year-old creator who uses [Product]. I understand the real concerns: retirement planning, college savings, portfolio diversification — because I'm living them.

I create authentic UGC that speaks to this demographic. Here's my work: [Portfolio Link]

Happy to create 2-3 pieces that actually resonate with your core customers.

### Smart Home Pitch (Personalized)

Subject: UGC for [Smart Home Brand]

Hi [First Name],

I've got [Product] set up in my home and genuinely love it — especially [specific feature].

I create UGC for the GenX audience. We're the ones actually buying this stuff (not just reviewing it for views). We want tech that works, isn't complicated, and actually improves our lives.

Most smart home UGC shows 20-somethings in minimalist apartments. Your customers are homeowners with families, careers, and zero patience for tech that doesn't work.

I'd love to show how [Product] fits into a real home, used by a real person.

Worth a quick chat?
