# UGC Business Plan: $5,000 in 30 Days

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Generate $5,000 in UGC income within 30 days  
**Target Niches:** Apps, Finance, Smart Home  
**Target Demo:** GenX (40-60 year olds)  
**Unique Angle:** Authentic GenX creator who actually uses these products — not a 22-year-old pretending to understand retirement planning

---

## The Math

To hit $5,000 in 30 days, here are the realistic paths:

| Scenario | Deal Size | Deals Needed | Close Rate | Pitches Needed |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Low-ticket | $150 | 34 | 5% | 680 |
| Mid-ticket | $300 | 17 | 5% | 340 |
| High-ticket | $500 | 10 | 5% | 200 |
| Premium | $1,000 | 5 | 3% | 167 |

**Realistic Target:** Mix of $200-$500 deals = ~15-20 deals needed

**Daily Output:** 
- Send 20 pitches/day minimum
- 600 pitches over 30 days
- At 3-5% close rate = 18-30 deals
- Average $300/deal = $5,400-$9,000
