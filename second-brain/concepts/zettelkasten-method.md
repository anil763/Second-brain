# Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") method is a personal knowledge management system developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann.

## Core Principles

### 1. Atomic Notes
Each note should contain exactly **one idea**. This makes notes:
- Easier to connect
- More reusable
- Simpler to understand

### 2. Unique Identifiers
Every note has a unique ID (in our case, the file path/slug). This allows for stable linking.

### 3. Links Over Folders
Instead of organizing by folders, organize by **connections**. Let structure emerge from links.

### 4. Your Own Words
Always write notes in your own words. This forces understanding and aids recall.

## The Two Slip Boxes

Luhmann maintained two boxes:

1. **Reference Notes** - Brief bibliographic notes
2. **Main Notes** - Your own thoughts and ideas

## How to Practice

1. **Read actively** - Note what interests you
2. **Write atomic notes** - One idea per note
3. **Connect notes** - Use [[Wiki Links]] liberally
4. **Review regularly** - Let serendipity happen

## Benefits

- **Compound Knowledge** - Ideas build on each other
- **Reduce Cognitive Load** - Your brain is for thinking, not storage
- **Combat Writer's Block** - Always have something to say
- **Discover Connections** - Find unexpected relationships

## Tools for Zettelkasten

- **Obsidian** - Popular markdown-based tool
- **Roam Research** - Outliner with bidirectional links
- **Second Brain** - That's us! 🧠
- **Physical cards** - The original method
