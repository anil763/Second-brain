# Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that involves reviewing information at systematically increasing intervals.

## The Science

### The Forgetting Curve
German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered that we forget information exponentially over time. Without review:
- After 1 day: ~70% forgotten
- After 1 week: ~90% forgotten
- After 1 month: ~95% forgotten

### The Spacing Effect
Reviewing at optimal intervals dramatically improves retention:
- First review: 1 day after learning
- Second review: 3 days later
- Third review: 1 week later
- Fourth review: 2 weeks later
- And so on...

## How It Works

```
Learning Event → Review 1 → Review 2 → Review 3 → ...
      Day 1        Day 2      Day 5      Day 12
```

Each successful review extends the interval.

## Implementation

### Tools
- **Anki** - Most popular SRS software
- **SuperMemo** - The original SRS
- **Readwise** - For book highlights
- **RemNote** - Combined notes + SRS

### What to Put in SRS
Good candidates:
- Vocabulary
- Facts and dates
- Formulas
- Concepts (use the [[Zettelkasten Method]] for deeper understanding)

Bad candidates:
- Highly contextual information
- Things that change frequently
- Complex procedures

## Combining with Note-Taking

Spaced repetition works best when combined with:
1. Active recall - Test yourself
2. Elaboration - Connect to existing knowledge
3. Interleaving - Mix different topics

## My Practice

I use spaced repetition for:
- Language learning (vocabulary)
- Programming APIs
- Key quotes and ideas from books
