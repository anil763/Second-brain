# Fear of Love → Fear of Success

## The Pattern

**In relationships:**
- "I don't allow anyone to love me because I'm afraid it will be taken away"
- Ran from every woman who expressed love
- Chose a marriage of resignation to avoid the risk of real connection

**In business:**
- Hesitation to fully show up
- Resistance to putting work out there
- Sabotaging opportunities before they can "reject" me

## The Connection

Both are about **vulnerability**.

| Love | Business |
|------|----------|
| Opening heart to another | Opening work to the world |
| Risk of rejection | Risk of rejection |
| Risk of loss | Risk of failure |
| Old wound: love was conditional/withheld | New wound: success feels unsafe/undeserved |

## The Root

Childhood messaging:
- "You're useless"
- "I wish one of you would die"
- Conditional love → Love = pain → Avoid love → Avoid success (which requires visibility)

## The Healing Path

**Current affirmations:**
- Lead with my heart
- Be authentic
- I am free to make my own choices
- Learn to love again
- Heal inner child
- Be open and take my guard down

**Business application:**
- Spiritual business *requires* authenticity
- Can't help others heal while hiding
- The same courage needed for love is needed for entrepreneurship

## Integration Practice

When business fear arises, ask:
1. What am I afraid will be "taken away"?
2. Whose voice is saying I'm not enough?
3. What would I do if I knew I was safe?
