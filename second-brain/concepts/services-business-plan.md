## Closing Thought

This business is not about being perfect. It's about showing up consistently, serving people genuinely, and trusting that the right clients will find you. The $33 readings you've already sold prove there's demand. Now it's about building the systems to serve more people while maintaining the quality and heart that makes your work special.

One reading at a time. One client at a time. One day at a time.

Let's go. 🚀
