Subject: GenX UGC Creator — {Specific Hook for Their Brand}

Hi {Name},

I'm Anil, a UGC creator focused on the GenX demographic (40-60) — an underserved but high-value audience in the {fintech/personal finance} space.

I noticed {specific observation about their brand/marketing} and think there's a content gap for authentic GenX voices.

**What I offer:**
- Native-feeling UGC for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube
- Scripts that speak to GenX pain points (retirement anxiety, debt, "starting late")
- Content that doesn't feel like "dad trying to be cool" or generic millennial content

**Recent relevant content:**
- {Link to your numerology content showing engagement}
- {Or mention your daily content habit — 7:30am posts, consistent output}

I'd love to create a test piece for {Brand} — no commitment, just see if my style resonates with your audience.

Best,
Anil Gunjal

1. **Day 1:** Send initial outreach
2. **Day 4:** Follow up with specific content idea

- [ ] Research 3 specific contacts at top 3 brands
- [ ] Create UGC portfolio page on anilcreates.com (3 sample videos)
- [ ] Draft 3 personalized emails using template above
- [ ] Set up tracking spreadsheet in Bento Backstage

## Key Insight

GenX is the **wealthiest generation** but most ignored by fintech marketing. Brands know they need this audience but don't know how to speak to them authentically. That's your edge.
