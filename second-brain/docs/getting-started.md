# Getting Started with Second Brain

Welcome to **Second Brain** – your personal knowledge management system inspired by Obsidian and Linear.

## What is Second Brain?

Second Brain is a tool for capturing, connecting, and retrieving your ideas. It follows the principles of the Zettelkasten method and Building a Second Brain (BASB) methodology.

## Key Features

### 1. Markdown-First
All your notes are stored as simple markdown files. This means:
- **Portability** - Your data is always yours
- **Longevity** - Plain text lasts forever
- **Flexibility** - Edit with any text editor

### 2. Wiki Links
Connect your thoughts using `[[Wiki Links]]`. This creates a network of knowledge.

For example, check out the [[Zettelkasten Method]] concept page.

### 3. Full-Text Search
Press `⌘K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to search across all your documents instantly.

### 4. Tags
Organize your notes with tags in the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: My Note
tags: [project, idea, important]
---
```

## Folder Structure

├── docs/           # General notes and references

## Quick Tips

1. **Capture Everything** - Don't filter, just write
