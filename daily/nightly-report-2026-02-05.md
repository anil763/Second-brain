## What I Built Tonight

### 1. UGC Brand Research ( `/ugc-outreach/2026-02-05-brands.md` )

**Researched 10 fintech/personal finance brands** actively buying UGC:

| Brand | Why Target | Contact | Opportunity |
|-------|------------|---------|-------------|
| YNAB | Strong GenX following, uses UGC | press@youneedabudget.com | #YNABWorks campaign |
| Empower | High LTV customers, wealth mgmt | media@empower.com | Retirement content need |
| Rocket Money | Subscription pain point | partnerships@rocketmoney.com | Heavy TikTok presence |
| NerdWallet | Syndicates creator content | press@nerdwallet.com | Mortgage/refinance angle |
| Betterment | Late retirement starters | press@betterment.com | "Retirement Goals" feature |
| Haven Life | Parents 40-55 | press@havenlife.com | Big budget (MassMutual) |
| Copilot Money | Beautiful iPhone app | support@copilot.money | Small team, accessible |
| Monarch Money | Premium pricing | hello@monarchmoney.com | Growing fast |
| Credit Karma | Complex credit histories | press@creditkarma.com | Intuit = massive needs |
| Stash | "Late starters" messaging | press@stash.com | "Invest in Yourself" campaign |

**Key Insight:** GenX is the wealthiest generation but most ignored by fintech marketing. This is your edge.

**Included:**
- Personalized email template
- Follow-up strategy (Day 1, 4, 8)
- Specific angles for each brand

## Tomorrow's Recommendations

**Morning (your 7:30am routine):**
1. Review tonight's brand list
2. Pick top 3 brands to pitch
3. Use the email template, personalize for each

**Midday:**
1. Set up UGC portfolio page on anilcreates.com (3 videos)
2. Set up Calendly for $50 readings
3. Download the outreach tracker, fill in your first 3 pitches

**Evening:**
1. Film one script from Batch 1 (start with Life Path Calculator)
2. Schedule tomorrow's content

---

## Key Insights from Tonight's Research

1. **GenX UGC is underserved** — most creators target Gen Z, leaving a gap you can own
2. **Fintech brands pay well** — older demographic = higher LTV = bigger budgets
3. **Your numerology content is your portfolio** — it shows consistency, engagement, storytelling
4. **Consistency beats perfection** — daily 7:30am posting is your competitive advantage

---
